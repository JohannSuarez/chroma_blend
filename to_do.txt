Use Type Hints


Finishing refactoring code to use classes.
    - chroma_blend2.py complete.
    - colorizer2.py complete.
    - vid2pngs.py complete


Then use pytest to make 
    - Unit tests, for each method of each class.
    - Integration tests, for each class.
    - System test, to simulate an environment as close to the end-user environment as possible.
    - A lot of the class methods have to be explicitly set as private functions (Internal use only)
